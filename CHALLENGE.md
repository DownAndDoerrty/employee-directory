# The Challenge
Showcase your skills by creating an employee directory web application composed of a frontend and backend built using modern tools. Include names, pictures, job titles, and anything else you see fit. Go as deep with the frontend and backend as you desire. For example, if you’re primarily a frontend developer, you could use an API mocking tool. If you’re primarily a backend developer, you could focus on implementing search or modern API standards like GraphQL or JSON API.

At Postlight, we value code quality and readability along with functional code. The code submitted should be production quality and something you would use in a real application.

# Suggested Features
We don’t expect you to complete every suggested feature below.
- Setup instructions and notes on how you built the application.
- Use of a frontend framework, ideally React.
- Modern API, we commonly use Node in-house.
- Ability to display employees by department, title, location, etc.
- Use of a client-side router
- Creative use of animation
- Paginated lists
- Forms for creating, updating, and deleting employees
- Source data from a third party person API
- https://randomuser.me is a good option
- Ability to search for employees
- Testing

# What We’re Not Looking For
We don’t expect your visual design to be perfectly polished. We’re more interested in your implementation than your design. It’s okay (and encouraged!) to use existing libraries and frameworks. 

We know you’ll be missing assets you would include in a production environment (like icons and logos). Skip those, and document what would be more complete in your project in a production environment.

# Delivery
Once complete, please submit your work using the unique link at the bottom of the email that included these instructions. We encourage you to include a git repository with history, excluding any files you would typically leave uncommitted (such as your node_modules folder).
